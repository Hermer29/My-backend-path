# My-backend-path

This repository is a place, where I want to save my backend learning path, sorry for my english, enjoy if u can

first-week i tried to create login operation. Now I know, what get and post methods don't transmit information, if you move user by header "Location"

second-week I learned, that I can use index.php as router, but not final. And code from weekly updates may not work, I just test

third-week I start reading about MVC pattern, it were not first object oriented pattern that I learned, there I tried, and I think I will finish MVC project, of course I still don't know it by 100%, so far so good
